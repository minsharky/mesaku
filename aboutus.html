                        <p style = "color: silver;"> 
                            Chef Chan Kim has been making sushi for over 15 years and has much experience
                            <br> with bringing top-quality sushi to his customers. He was the Executive Head Sushi Chef
                            <br> and General Manager at Tokyo Lunch Box in 10 branches for over 8 years. 
                            <br>
                            <br> For the past few years, he has been the team leader for other sushi chefs at Mariano's
                            <br> and has decided to open up his own restaurant to continue bringing sushi to his customers.
                            <br>
                            <br> "I know many people who have been wanting to try sushi for a long time, 
                            <br> but because of the price, they have been unable to experience the taste of sushi.
                            <br> With Mesaku Sushi, you only need less than ten dollars in order to fill your
                            <br> stomach with the wonders of Japan.
                            <br>
                            <br> I encourage everyone to try this type of unique and cultural food as it is a 
                            <br> very special type of cuisine that you should get to taste at least once 
                            <br> in your lifetime. Who knows, maybe you'll get addicted!"
